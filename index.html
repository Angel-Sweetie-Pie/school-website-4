                       Ambani attended the Hill Grange High School at Peddar Road, Mumbai, along with his brother and Anand Jain, who later became his close associate.[11] After his secondary schooling, he studied at the St. Xavier's College, Mumbai.[12] He then received a BE degree in Chemical Engineering from the Institute of Chemical Technology.[13][14]

Ambani later enrolled for an MBA at Stanford University, but withdrew in 1980 to help his father build Reliance, which at the time was still a small but fast-growing enterprise.[15] His father felt that real-life skills were harnessed through experiences and not by sitting in a classroom, so he called his son back to India from Stanford to take command of a yarn manufacturing project in his company.[9]

Ambani has been quoted as saying that he was influenced by his teachers William F. Sharpe and Man Mohan Sharma because they are "the kind of professors who made you think out of the box."[16

                       Neha Kakkar Singh (pronounced [ˈneːɦaː ˈkəkːər]; born 6 June 1988) is an Indian singer.[1][2][3] She began performing at religious events at the age of four and had participated in the second season of the singing reality show, Indian Idol, in which she was eliminated early. She made her Bollywood debut as a chorus singer in the film Meerabai Not Out. She rose to prominence with the release of the dance track "Second Hand Jawaani" from Cocktail, which was followed by several other popular party songs including "Sunny Sunny" from Yaariyan and "London Thumakda" from Queen.

Afterwards, she mostly performed party tracks like "Aao Raja" from Gabbar Is Back, "Tu Isaq Mera" from Hate Story 3, "Humne Pee Rakhi Hai" from Sanam Re and "Kar Gayi Chull" from Kapoor & Sons. She proved her versatility in musical range with the release of "Mile Ho Tum" from Fever which topped the list of most-viewed Bollywood songs on YouTube. She then released several chart-busters which made into the same list, including "Aankh Maarey" from Simmba, "Dilbar" from Satyameva Jayate , "Badri Ki Dulhania" from Badrinath Ki Dulhania, "Cheez Badi" from Machine, "Kala Chashma" for the film Baar Baar Dekho and the private single "Nikle Currant", all of which crossed over six hundred million views. Similarly, "Dilbar" marks the first Indian song to reach number three spot on the Billboard YouTube Music Chart.

From 2017 onwards, Kakkar, primarily, in collaboration with Tanishk Bagchi, became more associated with the trend of remaking old to very recent songs, which resulted in several backlashes targeted for the singer, though she personally favoured the trend of recreations and opined that they have been well-appreciated. Apart from playback singing, Kakkar has appeared in several music videos and as a judge on several television reality shows including "Indian Idol" On these shows, she has been trolled in social media several times for crying on-screen. She openly admits that she is a "proud emotional girl." She appeared in the India Forbes Celebrity 100 in 2017 and 2019.

In 2019, Kakkar was listed among the most viewed female artists on Youtube with 4.2 billion views.[4] In January 2021, she became the first Indian singer to win a YouTube Diamond Award.[5][6]

In December 2020, she appeared in the list of Asia's 100 Digital Stars by Forbes.[7
